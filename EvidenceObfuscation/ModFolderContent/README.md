# Piepieonline's EvidenceObfuscation

Replaces CityDirectoryPhoneNumbers.

Modifies the evidence presented in various places to be more obfuscated. Each change can be turned on and off separately.

* Change the city directory to list phone numbers instead of addresses. (Not all addresses have phones attached - in these cases, mostly businesses, the address will show as per normal)
  * Optionally, it can be changed to provide both pieces of information instead.
* Remove fingerprints from employee records, both printed from crunchers and found in filling cabinets (Toggled separately, off by default).
* ~~Change sales ledgers to contain various detials instead of always being the first initialed name (first name, initials, initialed name and workplace).~~ No longer required, this was added to the base game.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\EvidenceObfuscation\EvidenceObfuscation.dll"

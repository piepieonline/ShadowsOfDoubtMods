# Piepieonline's HireAHitman

Adds the option to hire a hitman over the phone to take out an NPC of your choice. Requires you to know their name and address, and have the fee (1000cr by default, configurable)
Once all occupants of a particular apartment are dead, and the crime scene has been cleaned, empty apartments will go on sale the next day.

Features:
* The hitman service is a phone number that can be found around the city, similar to the passwords for the black market or arms dealer (Requires a new city)
  * On existing cities, the number can be added to the phone 'Numbers' section by changing a configuration value (off by default)
* There is a brand new case type that is used when a hit is ordered, with new evidence in new locations.
  * By default, this case type is only used when you order a hit. This can be changed in the configuration to allow the case to always have a chance to be picked.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\HireAHitman\HireAHitman.dll"

# Future Goals:

* Make the player clean up the murder scene themselves
* Don't make the player arrest the murderer

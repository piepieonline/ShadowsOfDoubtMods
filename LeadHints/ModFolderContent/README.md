# Piepieonline's LeadHints

Displays the types of leads you'll receive in the 'Details' tab of job listings before accepting a side job.
I recommend using this mod in conjunction with 'SODQoL' to expire jobs that aren't taken automatically.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\LeadHints\LeadHints.dll"

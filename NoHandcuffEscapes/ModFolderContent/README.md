# Piepieonline's NoHandcuffEscapes

Enables configuration of the handcuff mechanic. By default, NPCs will escape after two in-game hours. By default, with this mod installed, NPCs will stay locked up for 24 hours.
Handcuffs can be configured to never release in the configuration, but this setting could soft lock your game, so use with caution!

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\NoHandcuffEscapes\NoHandcuffEscapes.dll"

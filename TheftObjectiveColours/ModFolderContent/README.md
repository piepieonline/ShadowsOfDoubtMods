# Pie's Theft Objective Colours

Adds colour variety to corporate theft objectives in SOD, making it easy to tell them apart. No more looking at a stack of identical envelopes and guessing.

Note: Once the job has been accepted, you can find the colour of the details tab of the Job Listing.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE and dependencies installed
* Extract the mod to `.\BepInEx\plugins\`, so you should have `.\BepInEx\plugins\TheftObjectiveColours\TheftObjectiveColours.dll`

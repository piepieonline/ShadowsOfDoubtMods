# Pie's Generic Patch

Various bugfix patches that I'm adding to/removing from as required.

Current fixes (* requires a new city to be generated):
* Fixes group meetups *
  * Groups and dates will actually meet up and in more locations than just the diners
* Adds retirees *
  * The 'retired' occupation is unused by default in SOD, but there are jobs and cases that assume it exists. This ensures that there are people in that occupation.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE and dependencies installed
* Extract the mod to `.\BepInEx\plugins\`, so you should have `.\BepInEx\plugins\Pies_Generic_Patch\Pies_Generic_Patch.dll`

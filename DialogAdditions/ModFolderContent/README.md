# Piepieonline's DialogAdditions

Adds and modifies dialog lines that the player can say.
* Added: A line to allows the player to ask some to call their partner when they answer the door
* Added: Show a photo of someone at an eatery, to find out if they regularly meet up with anyone there
* Changed: "Have you seen or heard anything"
  * If they know the person, and like them, they might lie. If they don't like them, they'll give more info.
* Changed: "Do you know this person"
  * People won't always answer if you present a photo of themselves (Depends if they would have answered "What is your name?").
  * Murderers will no longer 'know' the person they murdered to prevent self-incrimination

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\DialogAdditions\DialogAdditions.dll"

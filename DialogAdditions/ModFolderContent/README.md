# Piepieonline's DialogAdditions

Adds and modifies dialog lines that the player can say.

## Additions
* A new line that allows the player to ask someone to call their partner when answering the door
* Show a photo of someone at an eatery, to find out if they regularly meet up with anyone there

## Modifications
* Changed: "Have you seen or heard anything"
  * If they know the person, and like them, they might lie. If they don't like them, they'll give more info.
* Changed: "Do you know this person"
  * If the NPC works at an eatery, they may recognise their regular customers.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\DialogAdditions\DialogAdditions.dll"

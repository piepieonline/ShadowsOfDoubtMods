# Piepieonline's AdditionalEvidence

Adding additional evidence and evidence types, including bullet forensics

Current features:
* Adds weapon serial numbers (Found by scanning the weapon in your inventory)
* Adds bullet 'head prints' which can be matched between a found casing and weapon
  * Casings - Scan the casing in your inventory
  * Weapons - Configurable - If lab mode is enabled, the gun needs to be given to a scientist to scan for it's head print, otherwise the gun itself can be scanned.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\AdditionalEvidence\AdditionalEvidence.dll"

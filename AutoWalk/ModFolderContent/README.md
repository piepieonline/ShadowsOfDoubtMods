# Piepieonline's Autowalk

Adds a hotkey that can be held to enable 'autowalk' mode, where the character will keep walking forward until the walk forward input is released and reapplied.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\AutoWalk\AutoWalk.dll"
